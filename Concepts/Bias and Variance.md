# Bias and Variance

[Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqzgUnrNhFM)

### Underfitting
Error for training as well as test data is very high. Such a model has ***high bias and high variance***.

### Overfitting
Error for training data is low (or negligible), however it is very high for test data. Such a model has ***low bias and high variance***.

### Generally fitted model
Error is very low for both training as well as test data. Such a model has ***low bias and low variance***.

## Informal explanation/intuition
### Bias
Error associated with the ***training dataset***.

### Variance
Error associated with the ***test dataset***.

NOTE: ***Cross Validation Error*** is nothing but error for testing dataset
